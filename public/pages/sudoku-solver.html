            <h2>
                Sudoku Solver
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is one of my first projects, made while I was still in high school. It is a simple sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve any sudoku puzzle. I chose the project as a way to challenge myself and learn more about programming outside of school.
            </p>
            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
                The solver works using what's called a backtracking algorithm. The algorithm works by trying numbers in a cell until on is valid, then moving on to the next cell. If the algorithm reaches a cell where no number is valid, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. It's a simple but effective way to solve sudoku puzzles through brute force.
            </p>
            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This project, while objectively fairly simple, was a real challenge for me, as I was still in my first semester of programming courses while dual enrolled at Modesto Junior College. The project involved hours of research and work along with many concepts I hadn't yet learned in class.  I quickly came to realize that this is the rule rather than the exception in computer science. Overall, this project and others I made around the same time were a great learning experience, and layed the foundation I needed to continue learning and growing outside of the classroom.
