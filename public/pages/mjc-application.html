                MJC Club Application Portal
            </h2>
            <p>This website was designed to help MJC clubs fill out the required forms to be recognized as an official club on campus.  This site was built with the same group who created the CommunityALI platform, leveraging our experience with react to create a new project from the ground up.</p>
            <h3>
                Different Experience from CommunityALI
            </h3>
            <p> This project was a very different experience from building the CommunityALI platform.  We learned from our mistakes and applied all the lessons we had learned.  While CommunityALI was a large project with many different features, the Club Application Portal was a much smaller project with a very specific goal, and we knew exactly what we needed and when it needed to be done.  This allowed us to work much more efficiently and effectively, and we were able to complete the project in a much shorter time frame. In a way, I think of this project as the natural next step after CommunityALI, as it was a much more focused and refined project. </p>
            <h3>
                Identified problem
            </h3>
            <p> The problem we identified was that the current process for clubs to apply to become an official club at Modesto Junior College is very slow and cumbersome. Clubs had to fill out a variety of forms, and then submit them through email.  The information needed wan't too complex, but the systems in place were not very user friendly, and the process was slow.  Our platform aimed to streamline this process, making it easier for clubs to apply, and for the school to process the applications. </p>
            <h3>
                How it works
            </h3>
            <p> The site is a simple form that clubs can fill out to apply for recognition in one go.  Clubs can fill out the form, and then submit it to the school, which receives an email with the PDF of the form attached.  And that's pretty much it.  The site is responsive and easy to use, and saves progress as you go, so you can come back and finish later if you need to. </p>
            <h3>
                Mixed Results
            </h3>
            <p> While I am extremely proud of the work we did on this project, it never ended up getting implemented by the school.  Everyone we talked to including the head of student services and campus life thought our site was objectively better than the current system, but we had miscalculated how hard it would be to replace the current system with something new. In the end, it just wasn't worth it to the school to switch over to our system, and the project became just a portfolio piece.</p>
            <h3>
                Project Reflection
            </h3>
            <p> While it never got implemented, I am still happy with the work we did on this project.  It was a great learning experience, and I think we did a great job of creating a simple, effective solution to a real problem.  I think this project was a great example of how to work efficiently and effectively, and I am proud of the work we did. </p>
