                <h2>üïπÔ∏è Recently (at least at the time of writing), I had the opportunity to participate in a game jam! üü¶</h2>
              
                <p>
                  This was my first game jam, so I thought I‚Äôd share the experience. First, what exactly is a game jam? Basically, it‚Äôs an online event where a bunch of game developers come together and compete to create games that conform to a set of requirements, revealed at the start of the event, in a very limited timeframe.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  The jam I participated in lasted for 72 hours, which was all the time I was allotted to come up with a game idea, create art and music, build out the game, and share it with the other members of the event. The requirement revealed at the beginning of the jam was that all games be focused on shapes and patterns. Let's just say that the weekend included a fair bit of adrenaline, caffeine, and was some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in quite some time.
                </p>
              
                <h3>Results:</h3>
                <p>
                  Most importantly, I gained a lot of experience with the Godot game engine, which I want to use to make larger projects in the future. I also think I made a decent game‚Äîit was ranked 8th overall out of 29 submissions and took 1st place in the Gameplay category! I believe this game is worth more than 3 days of my time, so I‚Äôve been making improvements over the past week and have plans to try to monetize it in the near future!
                </p>
              
                <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>üü¶ <strong>Manageable goals:</strong> A lesson I seem to need to learn over and over again is to pick manageable goals. My natural instinct is to always do more than the minimum, which I really had to fight during this jam due to the hard deadline.</li>
                  <li>üü¢ <strong>Technical skills:</strong> Another reason I did this game jam was to get better at Godot, a game engine I‚Äôm interested in using as I explore the possibilities in the world of independent game development.</li>
                  <li>üü• <strong>Value of game jams:</strong> In my opinion, participating in this game jam was a great way to gauge my abilities as a new developer as well as gain significant experience without needing to spend months building a complex game. I‚Äôll be doing more of these in the future!</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>üéÆ After the Jam</h2>
                <p>
                  After the jam, I spent a few days polishing the game and adding some features I didn‚Äôt have time to implement earlier, after which I released it on CrazyGames, where it has already been played by 1000s of people! 
                </p>
