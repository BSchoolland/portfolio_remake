            <h2>
                Connect-4 Bot
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project is a command line connect-4 bot that uses a minmax algorithm to determine the best move.  The bot has 5 difficulty levels, which determine how many moves ahead the bot will look.  
            </p>
            <h3>Demo Video</h3>
            <p>
                A demo video of the bot in action, on its medium difficulty setting.

            <h3>Fun Additions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The ```parameters.json``` file can be used to change the dimensions of the board.  If you've ever wanted to play connect-4 on a 10x10 board, now you can!</li>
                <li>The program includes some cool sound effects for placing and thinking about moves, which is a little extra feature that I think adds a lot to the experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
            <p> The sinister thinking messages were generated by ChatGPT when it was still relatively new. </p>
            <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This was a small project, but it was a fun one.  I try to do a project like this every once in a while to keep my skills sharp, and learn new things like how a minmax algorithm works.  I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and while there are some things I could improve, I think it's a good project overall.
