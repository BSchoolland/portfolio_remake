            <h2>Simple Chat App</h2>
            <p>Something that is crucial for all programmers is to be able to understand and work inside of other
                people's codebases. This is a skill that I personally want to improve at.</p>

            <p>I was brought onto an existing project at my new internship for Bay Valley Tech - Free Code
                Academy. The project was an instant messaging web app, and a lot of people had already put a lot of time
                and effort into it. Since this was one of the first times I had the opportunity to work in a complex
                codebase I didn't help create, I wanted to be as knowledgeable as I could about the project's tech
                stack.
                One particular area I had no experience in initially was using Google's Firestore database for real-time
                messaging.</p>

            <p>Because I wanted to better understand Firestore, I spent some time creating
                a very simple instant messaging web application using a Firestore database. It was a great
                opportunity to learn more about the technology, and I wanted to share my thoughts.</p>

            <h3>Key Insights from Using Firestore</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Real Time Synchronization:</strong> Firestore made it very easy to implement this feature.
                    With a simple function call, the database would automatically update listening clients whenever
                    relevant data was modified.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Frontend to Database Communication:</strong> This was hard to get used to, but
                    Firestore allowed you to set up custom read and write permissions based on whether a user was
                    authenticated, which meant exposing the API key on the frontend was safe under certain conditions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>NoSQL:</strong> Firestore is a NoSQL database, meaning data is stored in collections and
                    documents, not tables. Both SQL and NoSQL have their use cases, and while I liked the structuredness
                    of SQL I could see how the flexibility of something like Firestore could be nice.</li>
            </ol>
