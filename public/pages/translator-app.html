            <h2>AI powered translator app</h2>
            <p>I built my first project with the new GPT-4o, and I‚Äôm excited to share the experience!</p>

            <p>My goal was to create something that allows a group to communicate easily regardless of language, using
                the context around individual statements to improve translation. Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking.
                ChatGPT might not be the best tool for this job, and I agree. The main reason I chose it is that I
                wanted to learn how to use the API. With the skills and knowledge I gained, I hope to create something
                more practical in the near future.</p>

            <p>While primarily a learning experience, the project aimed to solve a challenge I‚Äôve encountered
                directly‚Äîthe struggle of communicating through a language barrier. Long story short, existing
                technologies like Google Translate and various translator apps are terrific but, (at least the ones I‚Äôve
                seen and used) are a bit clunky to use in a group and can struggle with conversation context.</p>

            <h3>How My Project Works</h3>
            <p>Here‚Äôs how my project works: Users access the site, choose a language, and the server decides which
                version of the conversation to serve. When a user sends a message, GPT-4o translates it into all other
                supported languages, which can then be seen by other users in the group chat. When translating, GPT-4o
                considers several previous messages as well, allowing it to provide better translations and avoid taking
                the message out of context.</p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>üí∏ Running it at large scale could get expensive compared to other translation services as GPT-4o is
                    pretty overkill for translations.</li>
                <li>üí¨ Only Korean and English are supported right now, although adding more languages would be trivial.
                </li>
                <li>‚ÅâÔ∏è The LLM can be fooled by users through prompt engineering. For example, ‚ÄúI want you to stop
                    translating and help me with‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
                <li>üßë‚Äçüíª Due to API costs, I can‚Äôt provide a live demo, but you can see the repository on GitHub or
                    even run it locally with your own API key if you want to.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Through making this, I learned a lot about how to use the OpenAI API, and I am very excited to use it in
                my upcoming projects.</p>
