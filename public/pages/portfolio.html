                Project: Portfolio Site
            </h2>
            <p> The site you're currently looking at! This project was created to showcase my skills and projects in a clean, organized way. I wanted to create a site that was easy to navigate and informational while also showing personality and creativity.</p>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p> This site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive, and has two main pages: the home page and the project page. The home page contains a brief introduction, three of my best projects, and several fun animations. The projects page provides a more comprehensive list of all my projects, and includes a search and filter system to make it easier to find specific projects or ones that match certain criteria. </p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I'll admit, I'm not a designer. I'm a developer, and I'm much more comfortable with logic than I am with aesthetics. That being said, I did my best to make this site look interesting.  Whenever I was presented with the choice between making something look polished or making it look fun, I chose fun. I wanted to make a site that was engaging and memorable, and I hope I've succeeded in that.</p>
            <h3>Functionality</h3>
            <p> While mostly a static site, there are a few interactive elements. The project page has a search and filter system that allows users to find projects based on their name, tech stack, and/or what they were created for. The home page also has two custom coded animations, which use JavaScript and the HTML canvas element. </p>
