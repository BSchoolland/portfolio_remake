            <h2>
                My Old Portfolio
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project was my first portfolio website. Unlike my current portfolio, this one was built using Next.js.  It was a great learning experience, but I felt that I could do better.  
            </p>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The project aimed to showcase my work in a creative and visually appealing way.  It featured an unconventional layout, with some mini interactive projects in the hero section instead an image of myself.  The design has quite a few similarities with my current portfolio, with some of the same animations and a somewhat similar color scheme.
            <h3>So why did I change it?</h3>
            <p>
                While the visual design of this portfolio was impressive, it had some issues with mobile responsiveness, and was not as easy to update or maintain as I would have liked.  The main issue was the way I had structured the project. I had focused on making it look good above all else, rather than focusing on making it work well. I also felt it failed to capture my personality and my focus on code over design.  My new focus is on providing solid information in a way that is easy to understand as well update.
